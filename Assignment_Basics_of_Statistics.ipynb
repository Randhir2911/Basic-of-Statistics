        "\n",
        "**1. Explain the different types of data (qualitative and quantitative) and provide examples of each. Discuss nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio scales.**  \n",
        "- **Qualitative Data**: Descriptive, non-numeric.  \n",
        "  - *Nominal*: Categories with no order (e.g., colors, gender).  \n",
        "  - *Ordinal*: Categories with a logical order (e.g., survey ratings: good, fair, poor).  \n",
        "- **Quantitative Data**: Numeric, measurable.  \n",
        "  - *Interval*: Numeric, equal intervals, no true zero (e.g., temperature in °C).  \n",
        "  - *Ratio*: Numeric with a true zero (e.g., weight, height, age).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. What are the measures of central tendency, and when should you use each? Discuss the mean, median, and mode with examples and situations where each is appropriate.**  \n",
        "- **Mean**: Average; use when data is symmetric without outliers.  \n",
        "- **Median**: Middle value; best for skewed data or outliers.  \n",
        "- **Mode**: Most frequent value; use with categorical or discrete data.  \n",
        "*Example*: In {1, 2, 2, 3, 100}, median = 2, mean = 21.6 (misleading due to outlier).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Explain the concept of dispersion. How do variance and standard deviation measure the spread of data?**  \n",
        "- **Dispersion**: Measures how data is spread.  \n",
        "- **Variance**: Average of squared differences from mean.  \n",
        "- **Standard Deviation**: Square root of variance; shows average distance from mean.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. What is a box plot, and what can it tell you about the distribution of data?**  \n",
        "A **box plot** visualizes the five-number summary: minimum, Q1, median, Q3, and maximum.  \n",
        "It shows **spread**, **center**, **skewness**, and **outliers**.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**5. Discuss the role of random sampling in making inferences about populations.**  \n",
        "**Random sampling** ensures every individual has an equal chance of selection.  \n",
        "It helps reduce bias and makes **accurate generalizations** about the population.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**6. Explain the concept of skewness and its types. How does skewness affect the interpretation of data?**  \n",
        "- **Skewness**: Measures asymmetry in data.  \n",
        "  - *Positive Skew*: Tail on right; mean > median.  \n",
        "  - *Negative Skew*: Tail on left; mean < median.  \n",
        "Skewness affects the **central tendency** and **shape interpretation**.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**7. What is the interquartile range (IQR), and how is it used to detect outliers?**  \n",
        "- **IQR** = Q3 − Q1; shows the range of middle 50% of data.  \n",
        "- **Outliers**: Data points < Q1 − 1.5×IQR or > Q3 + 1.5×IQR.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**8. Discuss the conditions under which the binomial distribution is used.**  \n",

        "- Mean = Median = Mode.  \n",
        "- **Empirical Rule**:  \n",

        "\n",
        "**10. Provide a real-life example of a Poisson process and calculate the probability for a specific event.**  \n",
        "*Example*: Average 4 customer calls per hour.  \n",
        "Find probability of 2 calls in one hour:  \n",
        "P(X=2) = (4² × e⁻⁴) / 2! = (16 × 0.0183)/2 ≈ **0.1465**\n",
